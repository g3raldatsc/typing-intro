# Typing Intro

A simple Python program that displays a self-introduction using a typing animation effect in the terminal.

## Demo
This script prints text character-by-character to simulate typing.

```bash
Description
This project was made to experiment with console-based animations and text output timing in Python.
It uses:

time.sleep() to create delays between characters.

sys.stdout.flush() to update the console instantly.
